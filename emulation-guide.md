# Switch Emulation

Guide for emulating Nintendo Switch Games on PC
Unfortunately, since all of the games on the drive are in a special format that reduces file size, you need to use a tool in order to make them playable on PC, and the amount of time it takes to make it playable varies a lot depending on your setup.

## Requirements

[Ryujinx](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/25pn9ptowlxamod8/artifacts/ryujinx-1.0.5000-win_x64.zip)

[prod.keys](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aTgSpLSSDsTUrKpWgCJLKlvUPO5Csxb9/view?usp=sharing) (log into the account that has access to the drive before clicking this link)

[Nintendo Switch Firmware](https://mega.nz/file/xVwVFazC#sFkKEKkHhp2YEcqR5UQhAg_qxEPfZq8oRUalgleKVDA)

[nsZip (Windows only)](https://github.com/nicoboss/nsz/releases/download/3.1.1/nsz_v3.1.1_win64_portable.zip)

Games (get them from the switchgames folder on the drive, base folder is the base game, updates are updates for the games, dlc is dlc for the games, use google drive's search to find the games, spreadsheet coming soon)
